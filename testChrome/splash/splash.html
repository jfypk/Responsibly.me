            <p>Corporations are more powerful than ever, and great power comes great responsibility.</p>
            <p>Corporations need to do more to make sure their business practices are sustainable. They must help build a world where everyone is treated fairly and our environment is protected. It's time to use our collective purchasing power for good.</p>
